## Glossary

**Buffer tank (aka Decoupler):**<br>
A circulating fluid reservoir that separates the primary heat pump circulation loop (flow, temperatures) from the secondary loop supplying the emitters. Normally has four process nozzles (heat pump flow and return, emitter flow and return), plus drain/ABV. A type of low loss header.

Pros:

1. Adds volume, so smooths fluctuations, and reduces heat pump cycling frequency (can be better achieved with a volumiser).
2. Can allow for better matching of heat pump circulation flow and emitter requirements, especially if emitters are zoned.
3. Can be used as heat pump evaporator defrost heat source (depends on controller design).

Cons:

1. Requires an additional CH pump (increased capital and energy cost).
2. If primary and secondary loop flow rates are not reasonably matched, can result in reduced emitter temperatures thus system efficiency.
3. Additional inventory heat-up time, and heat loss source.
4. Extra capital cost.

**Cycling: Repeated stop-starts.**<br>

**Deadband: See Hysteresis**

**Emitter:** Radiator and/or under floor heating system

**Heat Meter: Device for measuring heat pump energy production.**<br>
Consists of a precision flowmeter in the circulation fluid and temperature sensors in the heat pump flow and return piping, and calculates heat flow from Q = M * Cp * °T (Typically pre-programmed for water, so recalibration needed for glycol solution due to differing Cp and  values.)

**Heat pump: ASHP or GSHP or WSHP**<br>
Device that uses electrical energy to drive a refrigeration cycle, thus transferring  heat from a cold source (ambient air, ground, water) to a warm sink (living space) in winter for space heating, and in some designs, the reverse in summer for space cooling.

**Hysteresis (aka Deadband)**<br>
The change required in a process variable to initiate a change in operation
Example: in a roomstat, the room temperature difference between demand on and demand off signals 

**Indoor Unit: Primary circuit components located inside the building**<br>
Compact unit offered by some vendors, typically comprising DHW tank, circulation pump (serving CH emitters and DHW coil, with diverter valves), expansion vessel, and the heat pump controller circuit board(s). Some vendors offer a remote display, located in a more accessible place, which may incorporate a roomstat.

**Operating map: Permissible system parameters programmed into heat pump controller.**<br>
For example, controlling expansion valve(s) and/or compressor speed to control suction and discharge pressure for refrigerant condensation and evaporation respectively.

**Outdoor Unit: Refrigeration circuit components located outside the building**<br>
The refrigerant circuit comprising compressor, a condenser (the heat exchanger with the CH/DHW circulating fluid), an expansion valve, and an evaporator (the heat exchanger with the heat source fluid – air [ASHP] or ground [GSHP] or water [WSHP]), and pipework/valving to allow reverse flow for evaporator defrosting (frequently a four-way diverter valve).

**P-H diagram: Pressure-enthalpy diagram**<br>

May be wired to heat pump controller (typically simple hysteresis-driven on-off), wireless (typically TPI control q.v.), or “smart” (TPI plus a learning facility that anticipates heating on-off requirement based on the user’s recent CH programming/setpoint demands)

**Setback: The night-time setting of the roomstat**<br>
Strategy to reduce energy consumption at times of lower warmth demand.

**Turndown: Minimum capacity (as a ratio or percentage) of design (maximum) capacity**<br>
May be limited by accuracy (e.g. flowmeters), or controllability (e.g. compressor speed due to surge onset), or vendor guarantee (e.g. onset of unpredictable performance).

**Volumiser**<br>
A circulating fluid reservoir that adds volume to the heat pump circulation inventory primarily to absorb flow and temperature changes between the heat pump and emitters. Normally has two nozzles.

Pros:

1. Adds thermal inertia so smooths fluctuations, and reduces heat pump cycling frequency.
2. Can be used as heat pump evaporator defrost heat source (depends on controller design).

Cons:

1. Additional inventory heat-up time, and heat loss source.
2. Extra capital cost.

**Water Law: Samsung terminology for weather compensation**

**Weather compensation: User-enabled option to set a target LWT based on ambient temperature**<br>
Typically, controller uses linear interpolation between two user-defined points on the ambient/LWT map to control heat pump output, often by compressor speed control. Intent is to recognise that higher emitter temperature will be required at lower ambient temperature (due to increased heat loss), but is simplistic as it takes no account of wind speed/direction which can affect heat loss significantly. 

**Zone: Separately controlled section of central heating system**<br>
Typically, radiators in house sections (e.g. upstairs/downstairs) or UFH.
